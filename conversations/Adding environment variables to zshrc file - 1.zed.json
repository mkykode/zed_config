Open your .zshrc file:\n   You can do this using a text editor. For example:\n   ```\n   nano ~/.zshrc\n   ```\n   or\n   ```\n   vim ~/.zshrc\n   ```\n\n2. Add the environment variable:\n   Scroll to the bottom of the file (or wherever you prefer) and add a line like this:\n   ```\n   export VARIABLE_NAME=\"value\"\n   ```\n   Replace VARIABLE_NAME with the name you want to give your variable, and \"value\" with the value you want to assign to it.\n\n   For example:\n   ```\n   export MY_API_KEY=\"abc123xyz789\"\n   ```\n\n3. Save the file:\n   In nano, press Ctrl+X, then Y, then Enter.\n   In vim, press Esc, then type :wq and press Enter.\n\n4. Apply the changes:\n   To make the changes take effect immediately in your current terminal session, run:\n   ```\n   source ~/.zshrc\n   ```\n\n5. Verify:\n   You can check if the variable was set correctly by echoing it:\n   ```\n   echo $VARIABLE_NAME\n   ```\n\nRemember that changes to .zshrc will only affect new terminal sessions by default. That's why step 4 is necessary to apply changes to your current session.\n\nAlso, if you want the variable to be available to all users and all programs (including those started from the Graphical User Interface), you might want to add it to /etc/environment instead. However, this requires root access and affects the entire system, so be cautious with this approach.\n","messages":[{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":0},"start":0,"metadata":{"role":"system","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":2}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":1},"start":2,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":1}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":4},"start":51,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":6}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":5},"start":1454,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":5}}}],"summary":"Adding environment variables to zshrc file","slash_command_output_sections":[{"range":{"start":0,"end":1},"icon":"Library","label":"Default"}]}
